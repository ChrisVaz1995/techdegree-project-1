        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I am inspired to become good in both front end and back end development. So that I can become a full stack developer. I hope that with the skills that I learn from the TD, will be able to transition to the real world and continue to learn. Maybe one day even teach other inspired developers. </p>
        <p>I love to play video games, watch anime and watch a lot of action movies. My favorite movie right now would be the Avengers: Infinity War.  </p>
